For parallel programming class we were expected to come up with a problem that requires
a high computation time and implement a parallel solution later on in order to
ease up on execution time. My project is to generate/sculpt terrain in a 3D app, then import
it to WPF and draw its terrain in a 2D fashion, namely to show the height information with 2D lines.
I implemented the basic marching squares algo, which by the end of the semester will be solved in parallel.
